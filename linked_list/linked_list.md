# Linked List

## P19 

classic question would be p.19, 
by using **fast n slow** pointers, we can traverse the linked list with fast first until it went n steps. Then 
use slow and fast together, make fast go all the way to the end. At that moment, the slow pointer will be n steps away
from the end.
